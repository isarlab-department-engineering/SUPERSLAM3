# SUPERSLAM3

SUPERSLAM3 is a visual odometry pipeline that combines the Superpoint-based front end with the ORB-SLAM3 pose estimation backend. In the implemented pipeline, traditional ORB and BRIEF feature detection and description methods have been replaced with the Superpoint pipeline.

In the SUPERSLAM3 pipeline, input images are converted to grayscale and fed into the Superpoint detector pipeline (A). The Superpoint encoder-decoder pipeline consists of a learned encoder, utilizing several convolutional layers, and two non-learned decoders for joint feature and descriptor extraction. The detected features are then processed by the ORB-SLAM3 backend, which comprises three primary components operating in parallel threads: the Tracking, Local Mapping, and Loop & Map Merging threads (B). The backend extracts keyframes, initializes and updates the map, and performs both local and global motion and pose estimation within the Local Mapping Thread and Loop & Map Merging thread. If a loop closure is detected, the pose estimation is further refined.

This repository was forked from [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3). The pre-trained model of SuperPoint come from the official [MagicLeap 
repository](https://github.com/MagicLeapResearch/SuperPointPretrainedNetwork).

# 1. Prerequisites
We have tested the libraries and executables on **Ubuntu 18.04**.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
ORBSLAM3 uses the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at least 3.0. Tested with OpenCV 3.4.11**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0. Tested with Eigen3 3.4.0**.

## DBoW3, DBoW2, Pangolin and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use a BOW vocabulary based on the [BOW3](https://github.com/rmsalinas/DBow3) library to perform place recognition, and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library is used to perform non-linear optimizations. All these libraries are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

### Download Vocabulary
The DBOW3 vocabulary can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1QEXTDYsbpid5ELp3IApQ8PGgm_vguC/view?usp=sharing). Place the uncompressed vocabulary file into the `Vocabulary` directory within the SUPERSLAM3 project. 
For more informations please refer to [this repo](https://github.com/KinglittleQ/SuperPoint_SLAM/tree/master).

## Nvidia-driver & Cuda Toolkit 10.2 with cuDNN 7.6.5
Please, follow these [instructions](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive) for the installation of the Cuda Toolkit 10.2.

If not installed during the Cuda Toolkit installation process, please install the nvidia driver 440:
``` shell
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-440
```

Export Cuda paths 
``` shell
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
sudo ldconfig  
```

Verify the Nvidia driver availability:
``` shell
nvidia-smi
```

Download [CuDNN 7.6.5](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cudnn/v7.6.5/cudnn-10.2-linux-x64-v7.6.5.32.tgz) from the official NVidia page, and install the headers and libraries in the local CUDA installation folder:

``` shell
sudo cp -P <PATH_TO_CUDNN_FOLDER>/cuda/include/cudnn.h <PATH_TO_CUDA10.1_FOLDER>/include/
sudo cp -P <PATH_TO_CUDNN_FOLDER>/cuda/lib64/libcudnn* <PATH_TO_CUDA10.1_FOLDER>/lib64/
sudo chmod a+r <PATH_TO_CUDA10.2_FOLDER>/lib64/libcudnn*

<!-- sudo cp -P <PATH_TO_CUDNN_FOLDER>/cuda/include/cudnn_version.h <PATH_TO_CUDA10.1_FOLDER>/include/ -->

The CUDA installation can be verified by running:
``` shell
nvcc -V
```
